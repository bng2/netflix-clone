  <br>Netflix ReactJS Clone
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  I built this Netflix Clone using <strong>React.JS</strong> for the Front-end and <strong>Firebase</strong> for the Back-end. This project includes the home page, sign-up page, login page, browse page, and the profile page. The user is able to create an account with an email and password, and browse the homepage or the profile page to purchase the a Netflix subscription plan. Stripe is implemented as the payment processor of choice, and the user's profile will be updated to display the current package and renewal date.
